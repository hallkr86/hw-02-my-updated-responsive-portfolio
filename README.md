Kesha Hall's Updated Responsive Portfolio

Our task was to return back to homework #2 and apply what we have learned the past 3 weeks as well as update our professional profiles and resume.

The technologies I used in Visual Studio Code to accomplish this assignment are listed below:
    1.HTML
    2.CSS
    3.Bootstrap
    4.Microsoft Word
    5.Adobe Acrobat Reader DC

The challenges I faced was not identifying the bugs that kept me from uploading my resume, centering and slimming my containers to align with my webpage.
